                TOWN combines a variety of chinese cuisine 
                to excite and delight our customers. 
                Our vision for the future is to create 
                experiential dining that is more than just 
                a night out. We aim to bring quality and 
                luxury across all aspects of our brand.
                The approach of TOWN is to develop our 
                brand with the understanding of both our 
                culture and consumer insights. Within our 
                vision always lives the promise of inspiring 
                creativity, conversation and quality. 
                Our audience is a high-end clientele who 
                values a dining experience. The age range 
                of our customers are from early 30s-60s. 
                We would like them to come back for both 
                personal dining and events.
